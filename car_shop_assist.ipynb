E.g. price range, brand, fuel type, transmission, etc.\n","* The prompt is designed to ask users questions one by one and buid a machine readable python dictionary as output\n","* Use of thought chain or flowchart as part of initial prompt to decide if we have enough data available\n","* openAI generates machine parseable dictionary as part of the first prompt, so we did not need another prompt to extract the dictionary. Simple string based parsing did the job.\n","\n","### Challenges faced.\n","* Understanding the API changes from the reference code wrt to the latest model supported by openAI\n","* Writing the system message prompt and fine tuning it to get the required results\n","* Anticipating user actions while writing the prompt to handle various scenarios\n","* Printing the conversation array which is mix of dictionaries and openAI class objects.
